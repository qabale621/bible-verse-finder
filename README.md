# QabaleVerseFinder

QabaleVerseFinder is a web application that provides users with random Bible verses or specific verses based on user input. The system fetches Bible verses using the Bible.org API and displays them to the user.

## Overview

This simple web application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers two main functionalities: retrieving a random Bible verse and allowing users to search for specific verses. The fetched verses are displayed on the webpage in a user-friendly format.

## How It Works

The application utilizes the fetch API in JavaScript to send requests to the Bible.org API. When a user triggers the "Get Verse" button, the system fetches a random verse and displays it. The "Search" functionality enables users to enter a specific Bible verse reference (e.g., John 3:16) in the input field and fetch and display that particular verse.

## Documentation

### HTML (index.html)

The HTML file contains the structure of the web page, including the main container, heading, verse display area, and form for user input.

### CSS (styles.css)

The CSS file styles the HTML elements to create a visually appealing layout. It defines the appearance of the main container, verse display area, and form components.

### JavaScript (script.js)

The JavaScript file contains the logic for fetching data from the Bible.org API. It handles user input, constructs the API request, fetches the data, and displays the fetched verse(s) in the designated area on the webpage.
